    "\n",
    "### To a module\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding a function to a submodule (e.g. `caffe.io`) is very simple, just add the function in the `python/caffe/io.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding it to the `caffe` module is slightly more involved: you have to modify `python/caffe/__init__.py` to make sure that it is imported into the scope of the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To a class\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a python-implemented function to a class, add it in `pycaffe.py`. Thanks to python's very lax typing system, you can just write `<class>.<function> = my_function`. You have the example of `Net`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def _Net_forward(self, blobs=None, start=None, end=None, **kwargs):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    \n",
    "Net.forward = _Net_forward\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This adds the possibility of running `net.forward()` with a caffe net. Note that the first argument of `_Net_forward` is `self`, the net the function is called on.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it a property (field) rather than a function (e.g. `blobs`), your function must take only one argument, `self`, and either be annotated with `@property`, or assigned with the property function (e.g. `top_names`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This function will be called when accessing net.blobs\n",
    "@property\n",
    "def _Net_blobs(self):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "class _Net_IdNameWrapper:\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    A simple wrapper that allows the ids propery to be accessed as a dict\n",
    "    indexed by names. Used for top and bottom names\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    def __init__(self, net, func):\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set the field `blobs` to call _Net_blobs\n",
    "Net.blobs = _Net_blobs\n",
    "# Set the field `top_names` to call that lambda, and get an instance of _NetIdNameWrapper\n",
    "Net.top_names = property(lambda n: _Net_IdNameWrapper(n, Net._top_ids))\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- To access implementation details, such as private fields\n",
    "- For better performance\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do that, you will need to add the binding to `python/caffe/_caffe.cpp`. At the end of the file, all the classes are defined, with their fields and methods bound to C++ fields/methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple field declaration will look like this (in the Blob definition):\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    ".add_property(\"num\", &Blob<Dtype>::num)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will bind the field `num` of the python `Blob` class to call the `num()` function of the C++ `Blob<Dtype>` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same syntax with `.def` instead of `.add_property` will yield a method instead of a field. You can implement the function in C++ and bind it directly (see `net.save`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "# Declare the function\n",
    "void Net_Save(const Net<Dtype>& net, string filename) {\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    ".def(\"save\", &Net_Save)\n",
    "```\n",

Usually, looking at the examples around will provide the needed documentation.\n",

    "Now that you have improved the `pycaffe` interface, it's time to give back to the community! You are using open source code, take some time to contribute!\n",
